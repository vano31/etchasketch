Etch-A-Sketch Project for The Odin Project

When prompted, type a number! That number will be the number of squares that makes up the Etch-A-Sketch's length and width.

This is a simple Etch-a-Sketch Project that I made for The Odin Project's Foundations course. This project was an introduction to DOM manipulation and its myriad possibilities. 

What I struggled with:
Adding and removing classes.

What I learned:
Asking for help from others is crucial. I needed to know that there are advantages and disadvantages to using Event Delegation Techniques for an entire DOM object (ie .onclick) vs using EventListener methods, since the former is easier to manipulate when you have a variable number of objects to manipulate on screen. I would not have known this if not for the help I recieved from the Odin Project Discord community.
